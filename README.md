### Length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
The bikeshare userbase covers all age demographics, from teenagers to adults; The graph shows us that 
teenagers and early-twenties enjoy taking much longer bikerides than older users.

### The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.
The following graph displays the number of rides initiated during each hour of the day. 
In a special way it also shows us the total for the month of August.
One can clearly visualize the highest use of the bikes during early hours of the day, as well as rush hour and end-of-workday commute times. 
What I also like about this graph is that shows us the low-usage hours between 2 AM and 5 AM.
These hours of the day are be the best times to repair and redistribute bikes from full stations to less-full stations.

In this graph we can also see compare how male users tend to be the target customers for the usage of bikes in comparison to female users.

# Summary
Bikesharing with Citibikes seems like a popular busuiness. I would say hoever that this business works well for busy metropolitan areas.
One thing to note from the data is that male users are the market in this business. 
Although some may argue that more needs to be done to to attract female riders, I would would say the opposite is true. The statistic shows that female users are 
less likely to ride the bikes to work and that makes since. I would say that in order to get the business to grow more should be done to attract even more 
male customers. I think that other visualtions that could help would be an actual map of the cities in question that show where the most use is. 
I would concule by saying that the business in the city of De Moines, would take some time to grow. It would be better to start small, maybe with 50 bikes 
in the most dense areas of the city, and if business seems good it would be good to expand the business further.
